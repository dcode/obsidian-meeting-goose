## Keeping It Updated

The dashboard doesn't auto-update. Run either command to refresh:

- `MeetingMind: Generate meeting dashboard`
- `MeetingMind: Update dashboard`

Both commands do the same thing—regenerate the dashboard with current data.

## Tips

- **Pin the dashboard** - Right-click the tab → Pin for quick access
- **Add to favorites** - Star it in your file explorer
- **Use with Dataview** - The dashboard complements Dataview queries; use both for different views
- **Schedule updates** - Run the command weekly or after importing new meetings

## Requirements

The dashboard analyzes notes that have meeting-like frontmatter:

```yaml
---
date: 2025-12-18
duration: 45
participants:
  - "[[Product Lead]]"
  - "[[Engineering Lead]]"
source: fireflies
---
```

Notes without this frontmatter won't be included in statistics.
